I'm too lazy to thoroughly test it, so it probably has some bugs (feel free to open up an issue if you want). I might come in and clean it up later if I feel like it, but for now it's pretty much finished.

FYI, the clear button (C) also clears the current operation. Also, there might be some precision issues with big numbers.

Also, there's keyboard functionality now. Everything is pretty much as you would expect. For clear, press "c" and for +/- press "p".
