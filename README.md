I'm too lazy to thoroughly test it, so it probably has some bugs (feel free to open up an issue if you want). I might come in and clean it up later if I feel like it, but for now it's pretty much finished. The scaling might be wack depending on what you're viewing it on (like Chrome on Linux is fine but Chrome on Windows is weird), just zoom accordingly and lmk if you know how to scale it relatively.

FYI, the clear button (C) also clears the current operation. Also, there might be some precision issues with big numbers.

Also, there's keyboard functionality now. Everything is pretty much as you would expect. For clear, press "c" and for +/- press "p".
